## Dependency verification

Gradle 6.2 ships with [dependency verification](userguide/dependency_verification.html).
Dependency verification is a major step towards a safer ecosystem by making it possible to verify both the checksums and the signatures of dependencies and plugins used during a build.

Please refer to the [userguide](userguide/dependency_verification.html) to figure out how to enable dependency verification.

We would like to give special thanks to [Vladimir Sitnikov](https://github.com/vlsi) for his feedback and inspiration.
A lot of the work on this feature is, in particular, available to previous versions of Gradle via his [Checksum Dependency Plugin](https://github.com/vlsi/vlsi-release-plugins/tree/master/plugins/checksum-dependency-plugin).

## Promoted features
Promoted features are features that were incubating in previous versions of Gradle but are now supported and subject to backwards compatibility.
See the User Manual section on the “[Feature Lifecycle](userguide/feature_lifecycle.html)” for more information.
